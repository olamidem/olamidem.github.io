                  Using <strong>Power Bi,</strong> I built a comprehensive

                   The HR data analysis project was able to provide valuable insights into an organization's human resources data.
                    The important takeaways include the total number of employees, year of service, workers who should be promoted, 
                    job positions, an employee who will be let off due to business concerns, employees that live a long distance 
                    away from the office, employee evaluation and work satisfaction evaluation, and employee travel situation.
                     These insights can be used to inform strategic decision-making, improve workforce planning, 
                     and identify areas for improvement.

                          The HR data analysis project aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of an organization's human resources data.
                          The project stage included data collection, cleansing, and analysis from multiple sources. This report will present the 
                          important takeaways from the project.<br/>

                          <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;">Data Collection and Cleaning:</strong>
                          The data was then cleansed and processed to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved identifying and correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing data points.
                          <br/>
                          <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;"> Key Findings:</strong>
                          The analysis of the HR data provided several important takeaways, which are discussed below.
                           <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">  Total number of employees</strong>
                         
                          <br/>
                          The analysis project was able to determine the total number of employees in the organization. This information is important for budgeting, workforce planning, and other strategic decisions.
                          <br/>
                          <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">  Year of service</strong>
                          <br/>
                          The analysis also revealed the length of service for each employee. This information is useful in identifying long-serving employees who may be due for promotions or additional benefits.
                          
                          <br/>
                            <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">   Job Position</strong>
                         
                          <br/>
                          The analysis also provided information on the job positions held by employees. This is important for identifying skills gaps, succession planning, and other workforce planning activities.
                        <br/>
                        <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">   An employee who will be let off due to business concerns</strong>
                          
                          <br/>
                          The analysis project also identified an employee who will be let off due to business concerns. This information is important for managing the impact of downsizing or restructuring activities.
                         
                          <br/>
                          <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">  Employees that live a long distance away from the office</strong>
                          
                          <br/>
                          The analysis also revealed employees who live a long distance away from the office. This information is important for identifying potential issues with employee travel, such as long commute times, which may affect productivity or work-life balance.
                          <br/>
                           <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;"> Employee evaluation and work satisfaction evaluation</strong>
                          
                          <br/>
                          The analysis project also provided insights into employee performance and job satisfaction. This information is useful for identifying areas for improvement, providing feedback to employees, and identifying training needs.
                          <br/>
                           <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Employee travel situation</strong>
                          
                          <br/>
                          Finally, the analysis provided information on employee travel, including the frequency and purpose of travel. This information is important for managing travel expenses, identifying potential health and safety risks, and ensuring compliance with travel policies and regulations.
                          <br/>
                          <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Result Interpretation</strong>
                           <br/>
                          The final step involved result interpretation, which aimed to provide meaningful insights and recommendations based on the analysis. Based on the results of the HR data analysis project, the following recommendations were made:
                          Develop a promotion plan that considers length of service, performance, and other factors to ensure fair promotion practices.
                          Conduct a job satisfaction survey to identify areas for improvement and increase employee engagement.
                          Develop a travel policy that balances business needs and employee well-being, particularly for employees who travel frequently or live a long distance away from the office.
                          Consider workforce planning strategies that take into account the organization's talent pool, skills gaps, and potential downsizing or restructuring activities.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          <strong style="color: black;font-size: 18px;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</strong>

                          The HR data analysis project was able to provide valuable insights into an organization's human resources data. The important takeaways include the total number of employees, year of service, workers who should be promoted, job positions, an employee who will be let off due to business concerns, employees that live a long distance away from the office, employee evaluation and work satisfaction evaluation, and employee travel situation.

                  This dashboard focuses on real estate and property management. 
                  It looks at the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

                      | The total number of properties is | Floor types and waterfront | The properties' locations | Conditions of the properties. <br/>
                      <br/>
                      The study is intended to offer decision-makers insights into the status of the assets, allowing them to determine which ones require immediate attention and repairs.
